# Building a Controller
*Fly Car Nanodegree - Project 3*

## Motor Commands
In order to calculate the correct individual motor thrusts given a collective thrust and a 3-DOF
moment, we need to solve the following equation:

![thrust equation](/animations/thrust_eqn.gif)

Because the matrix is square (and non-singular) it is easily invertible, which will provide us
with a solution to the individual motor thrusts. The solution to this equation was implemented
in the `QuadControl::GenerateMotorCommands(...)` method.

## Implemented Controller
The following sections provide an explanation of the implementation of the various components
required to implement the quadrotor controller.

### Body Rate Control
Body rate control was implemented using the simple proportional control law:

Once implemented in `QuadControl::BodyRateController` the gains were tuned to achieve good
performance.

### Roll/Pitch Control
The roll & pitch controller is slightly more complicated. First, the vertical acceleration must
be calculated from the collective thrust command and the mass of the vehicle. From here the in-plane
acceleration commands can be used in conjunction with the vertical acceleration command to calculate
the commanded "pitch" and "roll" of the vehicle (these aren't actually pitch and roll angles). These
values (`b_x_c` and `b_y_c`) are constrained to be within `Â±maxTiltAngle`.
From here a proportional feedback law can be used to calculate an euler rate command:

We must then take this euler rate command and convert it into a body rate command, which is
demonstrated in the `QuadControl::RollPitchControl` method.

### Altitude Control


### Lateral Position Control

### Yaw Control

## Flight Evaluation
The implemented controller allows the quadrotor to successfully perform each of the 5 provided
scenarios within the required performance envelope.
